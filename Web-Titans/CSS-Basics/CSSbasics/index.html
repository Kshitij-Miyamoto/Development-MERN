    <body>
       <pre>    I am kshitij Sharma, All my energy reserves and monetary resources should be directed towards carving a strong, functional and aesthetic body and hence a beautiful mind.

    I am a sculptor to my malleable body and mind, I am building myself one day at a time, every counterproductive indulgence is like chucking of a piece of clay from my body.
    
    Hence I am alive.
    
    Rather than blatantly surfing YouTube we can use that time for better pursuits like reading and writing, may be get my hands dirty with content creation.
    
    Study-Strength-Walk-Repeat.
    
    If I want to crack this fucking examination, I will have to graduate to 10 hours of study each day, only then I will have a realistic chance.
    
    Reminder : I can only afford supplements not extravaganza.

 <p>Social media is fucking dumb and is just a leach to my progress, sucking my life sap, by social media I mean everything unnecessary videos, reddit, twitter, instagram and YouTube.
    If I just be selective and delete all the dumb applications, I can do so much, study so much and build so much.
    I am seeing my intelligence being reduced by social media, I am turning into a mediocre zombie piece of shit.
    Here are some things that I got to do, In order to revive myself : 
    
     Completely stay off social media and embrace better forms of entertainment things which arenâ€™t counterproductive and help me in my long term goals 
    
     Reading, Writing, Music, gymming are somethings that I enjoy and are apt replacements for social media
