        <h1> Hi there !!</h1>
        <p>Social media is fucking dumb and is just a leach to my progress, sucking my life sap, by social media I mean everything unnecessary videos, reddit, twitter, instagram and YouTube.
            If I just be selective and delete all the dumb applications, I can do so much, study so much and build so much.
            Body is a piece of hardware and Mind is a piece of software, I produce desired output by working harmoniously with these two.
All this machinery need some oiling and maintainance to keep peace.

Sincerity and being humble has been a very underrated skill always.

I will just do what I need to do,
Be innocent and have a truthful approach towards my pursuits,
Just give my honest attempts towards my pursuits.
