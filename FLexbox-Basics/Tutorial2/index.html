                    So yeah, I am slowly becoming the epitome of mediocrity not a renaissance man but a jack of all master of none kind of person.
I have very mediocre academics and absolutely no projects on top of that, my career right now is in absolute shambles.
Solution ? To step up and get the stuff done, we have  7 months for a life altering critical event we make sure that we put out best foot forward, 
these are the only 7 months that I can devote to this preparation, otherwise I will have to pivot and compromise with a very mediocre life and mediocre
 standard of living.
It is time to zone in and just keep doing stuff. Till we get where we want to in our life

            life, be it dabbling into various technologies, 
           learning guitar or learning DSA you have got to start now.
           “Start now there ain’t no tomorrow”. This is cliche but true.
           
           Whenever you think and don’t act you are wasting your time in empty dreams.
